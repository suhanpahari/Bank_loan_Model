# Bank Loan Prediction Model using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Bank Loan Prediction Model project! ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ This project focuses on utilizing various machine learning models to predict loan approval outcomes for applicants. Whether you're a financial analyst or just curious about the factors influencing loan approvals, this project has you covered.

**Introduction**
Navigating the complexities of loan approval decisions can be challenging. This project aims to simplify the process by employing machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on a set of features. By leveraging a dataset containing historical loan data, we can train and evaluate different machine learning models to provide accurate predictions.

**Features**
Multiple Models: Explore the performance of different machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to find the most suitable one for your loan prediction needs.
Feature Importance: Understand the key factors influencing loan approval decisions through feature importance analysis provided by the models.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: The Python script provides an intuitive command-line interface for seamless interaction.
**Getting Started**
**Dataset:** Acquire the dataset containing historical loan data. Ensure it includes relevant features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, etc.

**Installation:** Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:


*git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-loan-prediction.git
cd bank-loan-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt*
Configuration: Open config.py and customize parameters such as dataset path and model selection.

Run the Script: Execute the main script to train the models and make loan predictions:

*python loan_prediction_model.py*
